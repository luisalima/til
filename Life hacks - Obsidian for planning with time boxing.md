If you use a combination of [time boxing]() with todo lists for planning your day, here are some amazing Obsidian plugins.

* Daily note is now a part of core Obsidian, so you can use that to create your daily plan. Then, use...
* [Day planner](https://github.com/ivan-lednev/obsidian-day-planner), which allows you to do day planning from a task list in a markdown note with time block functionality and a way to visualize your day.
* [Rollover Daily Todos](https://github.com/lumoe/obsidian-rollover-daily-todos) does just what the name says.
